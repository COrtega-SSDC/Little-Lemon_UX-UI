Problem Statement:
 	The Little Lemon restaurant in Chicago, Illinois, is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. One of the owners of Little Lemon, Adrian, received feedback from customers who experienced issues using the mobile version of the website. They had trouble placing a delivery order and reserving a table. The mobile site was confusing and missing a lot of features, which made it difficult to accomplish these two tasks. After improving the delivery section, Adrian wants to move forward to adding the ability to reserve a table on the Little Lemon mobile site. Currently, it is not possible to reserve a table at Little Lemon, despite the homepage including a "Reserve a table" button.
